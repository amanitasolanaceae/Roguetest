# YASDK would be impossible without
- [BearLibTerminal - Interface library for ... text-based console-like output](https://github.com/cfyzium/bearlibterminal)
- [classy.moon - An extendible skeleton for object classes](https://github.com/johnae/classy)
  - In YASDK, `classy` was forced into a new language and then disfigured; this edited version is known as `proto`
- [MoonLibs - Graphics and Audio Lua Libraries](https://github.com/stetre/moonlibs)
  - These in particular:
    - [MoonSndFile - bindings to **libsndfile**](https://github.com/stetre/moonsndfile)
    - [MoonAL - bindings to **OpenAL**](https://github.com/stetre/moonal)
